The veggie is an app created using firebase. its purpose is to serve local-street vendors in a small colony of people who want to do their business online. Whenever an order comes, the seller can send his delivery boy to deliver veggies. it is an app for vegetable sellers who are due to covid, were not able to sell their vegetables online. the seller can enlist their product through the admin app. the purpose of this app is to serve the local vendors and sellers that's why it doesn't contain any online payment gateway consequently we tried to keep its interface and functionality very simple.
